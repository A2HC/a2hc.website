A complex combination of clinical, demographic and lifestyle parameters 
determines the correct diagnosis and the most effective treatment for **asthma** and **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease** patients. 
Artificial Intelligence techniques help clinicians in devising the correct diagnosis 
and designing the most suitable clinical pathway accordingly, tailored to the specific patient conditions. 
In the case of machine learning (ML) approaches, 
availability of **real-world patient clinical data** to train and evaluate the ML pipeline deputed to assist clinicians in their daily practice is crucial. 
However, it is common practice to exploit either synthetic data sets 
or heavily preprocessed collections cleaning and merging different data sources. 
In this paper, we describe an **automated ML pipeline** designed for a real-world data set 
including patients from a Dutch primary care service, 
and provide a **performance comparison** of different prediction models for 
(i) assessing various clinical parameters, 
(ii) designing interventions, 
and (iii) defining the diagnosis.
