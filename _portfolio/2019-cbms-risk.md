Clinical research and practice are rapidly changing 
mostly due to Information and Communication Technology, 
especially, as Machine Learning (ML) offers great potential 
for predictive and personalised medicine. 
Nevertheless, barriers are still existing 
for widespread adoption of ML tools, 
as highlighted by studies from the European Union. 
In this paper, we propose an architecture 
for a Decision Support System assisting clinicians 
in assessing health risk of patients 
by delivering **"Risk Prediction as a Service"**. 
By leveraging standard web technologies 
as well as the PMML and PFA formats 
for exchange of trained models, 
we achieve **ubiquitous access** to predictions, 
**ease of deployment**, 
and **seamless interoperability**, 
while promoting collaboration.
