Hi fellow researchers 👋

Quick post to share a very nice opportunity: 
a few friends of ours are running an online course about **application of AI techniques to the healthcare domain**:

> 📌 [https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-artificial-intelligence-can-support-healthcare](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-artificial-intelligence-can-support-healthcare) 📌

The course encompasses 
<!--more-->
both technical aspects but most importantly 
**cross-cutting aspects** such as regulatory issues,
ethical issues,
relationship with patients and clinicians,
peculiar requirements of the healthcare domain,
known limitations of AI,
and so on.

The course is 💸 **extremely low priced** 💸 
and gives unlimited access to the course material.
Also, lecturers are experienced researchers and practitioneers with yearly experience not only on research,
but also on actually translating research outcomes into actionable software products.
For instance, friends from the [UMCG](https://www.umcg.nl) have collaborated with some of us in the past
in the context of the outstanding [CONNECARE]() EU H2020 project.

Don't miss this great opportunity ❗️
