Agents Applied to Healthcare is a workshops series now going on since several years (see [workshop editions](/workshops/) page), aimed at bringing together researchers from the **agent and multi-agent systems** community and researchers and practitioneers applying their expertise in the broad **healthcare domain**, in a friendly environment where critical discussion and collaboration are welcome.

This website hence born out of the need to have a **reference (virtual) place** where such communities could look at seeking for 
  - [related publications](/publications/)
  - stimulating discussions and point of views (in [the blog](/blog/))
  - collaboration opportunities

curated, *at the moment*, by the organisers of the workshop series (in the [people](/people/) page).

As such, **anyone** interested in participating in such a community, can [write us](mailto:a2hc.org@gmail.com) and ask to join us in maintaining the website active and engaging (e.g. getting permission to post to the blog).

We hope you like this initiative, don't forget to submit your research works at the next edition of the [A2HC workshop](/workshops/) ;)
